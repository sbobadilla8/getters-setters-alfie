Meeting Summary:

- Review of the changes on the report document: AJ going over the changes he made
- Explain confusing points from before, deciding to:
  - Single email per role
  - Multiple admins possible but always at least one
- We will settle on at least one admin that is going to be predefined in the database, will extend this in the future if needed or just consider it an extension.
- Remember to add the cancellation of events/tickets in the post conditions of the relevant use cases.
- It has been noted that we are not going to actually delete records from the database, just mark the element as inactive.
- Make a “Shared use cases” section and remove them from each actor, also listing the actors they apply to.
- Have all use cases by wednesday night, and the domain model by thursday lunch time. Friday 12 pm we must have all comments/doubts solved, and make the submission around 2 pm.
